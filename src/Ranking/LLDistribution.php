/**
 * Information-based models are family of classes for ranking documents against a query based on the fact that the 
 * difference in the behaviors of a word at the document and collection levels brings information on the significance 
 * of the word for the document (2-Poisson, see DFR classes) combined with Church and Gale's phenomenon of term burstiness.
 * 'Once they appear in a document, they are much more likely to appear again'.
